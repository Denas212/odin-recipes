    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 pound hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>2 table spoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Cut down the length of each sausage with a sharp knife. 
                Remove and discard casings.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan set over high heat. 
                Add sausages and onion. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up with a spatula, until sausage begins to brown, and onion turns translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Add oregano, thyme, and rosemary and cook for 1 minute more.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in marinara sauce. 
                Pour 1 cup water into each jar to rinse out remaining sauce; add to the saucepan. 
                Stir together and bring sauce to a simmer.
            </li>
        </ol>
