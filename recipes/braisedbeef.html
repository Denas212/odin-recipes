    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. 
        It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3,5 pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder/li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 
                2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, 
                reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases 
                easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. 
                Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. 
                Remove meat from the pan and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
